## Bias in surveys

If you're conducting user research, you should be seeking the truthful answers – not just what "sounds best" or aligns with your goals. Unfortunately, it's very easy to guide users to "telling us what we want to hear" by asking the wrong questions.

## Leading Questions

To avoid leading questions, think like a lawyer. From [The Legal Seagull](https://thelegalseagull.com/blogs/news/how-to-handle-objections-to-leading-questions):

<Panel className="my-6">
  <p>
    <strong>Example #1</strong>
    <strong></strong>: “You were at Seagull’s Pub the night of October 31st,
    right?”
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example #2</strong>
    <strong>:</strong>&nbsp;"Didn't you only drink water all night while the plaintiff
    had four pints of beer?"
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example #3</strong>
    <strong></strong>: "You told the bartender that you would follow Jim home,
    didn't you?"
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you see the answers embedded in these questions? According to the
    examiner, the witness:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Was at Seagull’s Pub on October 31st;</li>
    <li>Only drank water (but the plaintiff had four beers); and</li>
    <li>Told the bartender that he'd follow Jim home.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    Isn't that so? Objection. Leading the witness. In all three examples, the
    opposing attorney should (and probably would) state an objection.
  </p>
  <p>
    You might be wondering: what is wrong with leading a witness? Leading
    questions can be problematic because they allow the examiner to unduly
    influence or control the witness’ testimony. Non-leading questions provide a
    more “natural” flow of testimony based on the witness’ personal knowledge
    and recollection of the events.
  </p>
  <p>
    One of the easiest ways to overcome the objection is to rephrase the
    question to get the testimony you need without putting words in the
    witness's mouth.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example #1</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Original</strong>: “You were at Seagull’s
    Pub the night of October 31st, right?”
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rephrased</strong>: "Where were you on the
    night of October 31st?"
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example #2</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Original</strong>: "Didn't you only drink
    water all night while the plaintiff had four pints of beer?"
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Rephrased</strong>: "What did you drink
    during your time at the Pub?"
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Follow up</strong>: "What did the
    plaintiff drink?"
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Example #3</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Examiner</strong>: "You told the bartender
    that you would follow Jim home, didn't you?"
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Opposing attorney</strong>: "Did you say
    anything to the bartender before you left that night?"
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Follow up</strong>: "What did you say to
    the bartender?"
  </p>
  <p>Can you see the difference?</p>
  <p>
    The leading question assumes an answer that the examiner is hoping to
    confirm. Whereas, the non-leading form allows the witness to offer a range
    of responses from their own recollection of the events — and is therefore
    non-leading.
  </p>
</Panel>

In surveys, leading questions can create an enormous bias in the results. Not only would any "findings" be unethical to claim, but the research is not useful to you as a UX professional. It is not revealing a truth; only confirming the answer you were hoping for.

## Institutional Review Boards

Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) are essentially formal ethics committees. They can help to prevent bias and unethical testing – in some regulated fields, their approval is required.

  <p>
    The purpose of IRB review is to assure, both in advance and by periodic
    review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare
    of humans participating as subjects in the research. To accomplish this
    purpose, IRBs use a group process to review research protocols and related
    materials (e.g., informed consent documents and investigator brochures) to
    ensure protection of the rights and welfare of human subjects of research.
