## The Project Starts Here

A client comes to you with a project idea, and you're interested. Now what? Before you can create a prototype, you need to figure out crucial information.

For this demo, your client wants to create "Pixafood", an Instagram-like service for foodies. Users can post photos, tag restaurants and dishes, and discover recommended places. Restaurants benefit by having their dishes featured and recommended; they can reach out to Pixafood users to use their photos on social media.

We need to make sure that we are on the same page as the client. A few questions to consider:

- Do users create accounts or log in with social media?
- Do restaurants get accounts too?
  - How can restaurants request to use a photo?
  - Are they required to credit the user?
- Are photo feeds public or can only registered users/restaurants see them?
- How are photos organized and searchable?
  - By restaurant?
  - By type of cuisine?
  - By custom tags?

## What is a Flowchart?

A flowchart is a diagram that shows a process or set of steps. It combines simple drawings (boxes and arrows) with short descriptive text to depict a series of actions (or possible actions).

We use flowcharts to...

- Organize the design
- Communicate with the programing team
- Test a user's ability to navigate
- Cheaply asses the project
- Break the work up
- Find problems with the design

## Where to Begin

Start with the first screen that a user will see. Think about your questions; many of those will introduce a new screen. Figure out how you want users to interact with the information, then create arrows and connections to define a "path" through your application. Use page descriptions and vague shapes to show what goes where.

- What are the requirements and needs of the app?
- What is the first screen?
- What device(s) are you designing for?

## What to Use

UX is a very flexible field, and you'll often have the opportunity to choose the best tool for the job. From low-tech to high-tech,  there are many ways to work. View the slides for any method you are interested in:
