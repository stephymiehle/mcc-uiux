  <p>
    The main purpose of this demo is just to show you how simple I think
    usability testing can and should be. In most ways, this demo is exactly like
    the kind of tests I recommend you do on your own web site. The main
    difference is that an actual test would have more tasks or longer tasks, so
    it would last about an hour instead of 20 minutes.
