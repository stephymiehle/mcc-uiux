User testing can be conducted in many ways, even online (and [you can get paid for it too!](https://www.usertesting.com/be-a-user-tester)). Consult the instructions on the [screen recording page](/screen-recording) for information on tools you can use to perform virtual user tests.

## Preparing to Test

### In-Person

- Find a quiet, distraction-free area where you can sit with your tester and use your computer
  - No background TV/music/etc.
  - No friends or family bustling around
- Print a [consent form](/scripts-and-resources) for each tester
  - In the real world, each scenario would be tested multiple times by multiple people and the results would be compared. Each tester needs their own printed consent form.
- Customize your [testing script](/scripts-and-resources) in advance by filling in the blanks and making any necessary edits
- Have your browser open to a neutral screen, such as [google.com](https://www.google.com)

### Virtual Testing (Remote/Online)

If you are not able to conduct a test in person, you can ask your tester to share their screen. This brief walkthrough is written for [Google Meet](https://meet.google.com/), which is free and easy to use if you already have a Google account. Other popular options include Zoom and GoToMeeting.

To cut down on echoing, it's recommended that both you _and_ your tester use headphones during the chat. Each of you should also have audio recording (microphone) capabilities.

- Share your [consent form](/scripts-and-resources) in advance
- [Start a video chat](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9302870) by scheduling a calendar event in advance or creating a new meeting link when needed
- [Add your tester to the video chat](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9303164); copying the joining information to an email or instant message is easiest
- Help your tester [share their screen](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308856?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) by providing instructions and help
- Have your tester open your prototype; you can send them the link in advance or [as a chat message in Google Meet](https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9308979?hl=en&ref_topic=7290350)
- Confirm that you can see their screen clearly with the prototype window maximized before proceeding

## Performing the Test

- Read your testing script aloud, replacing information as appropriate
  - This should be repeated for each tester
  - If you are only testing with one tester, only one run-through of the script is needed
- Have your tester sign and date the consent form; keep this somewhere safe and consider scanning the form or taking a picture for your records
- **Begin recording!**
- Open your prototype in prototype mode (one screen at a time)
- If you are performing a short interview before completing tasks, ask your questions
- Read through one scenario at a time
- Let your tester navigate through your interface
  - Encourage your tester to "think out loud", especially if they are confused
  - **Do not try to lead your user to success!** Users should make their best effort based on their interpretation of the scenario; read the [“Things a therapist would say” document](/scripts-and-resources) by Steve Krug

## After Recording

- Thank the tester for their time
- Answer any questions
- Scan each signed consent form OR take a good-quality picture
- Keep your screen recording(s) somewhere safe
