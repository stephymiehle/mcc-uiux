Straightforward concepts are easier to understand than abstract ones. This is especially important when selecting icons for an application. If you choose to use icons, the fastest-interpreted option will perform better than one that is too detailed.

Even then, [label your icons](https://uxdesign.cc/label-your-icons-e2bd57366d37) to make the interpretation and association even easier.

    [S]aying that the users will know what it is because they have seen it
    everywhere is like saying that anyone can identify any kind of tree because
    they have seen a tree before. Just because I have seen a tree doesn't mean I
    can identify a maple tree. And for icons, this can be compared to seeing a
    hamburger icon and a house icon and they both mean “menu”.

    This “they will know what it means” logic does not work. Not only does it
    not make sense, but following that logic is literally making an assumption
    for the user. <strong>We are not the users.</strong> What we assume they
    have seen is probably not what they have actually seen. We should never
    assume the users will understand things because we think its basic
    knowledge.
