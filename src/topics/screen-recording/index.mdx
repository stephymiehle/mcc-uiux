## Uploading recordings

Once you've recorded your screen, it's time to share your files. Some recording software comes with an option to upload your files on their servers, but others only cover the actual recording part and require that you host your videos somewhere else. Note that you will need to register for an account with any of the video-sharing or file-sharing platforms.

Recordings can be large! If Canvas does not allow you to upload your recording (or if you'd just like to have a backup elsewhere), you can upload your video to any of these free video services.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com)
- [Vimeo](https://www.vimeo.com)

You can also share your videos through popular file-sharing services:

- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
- [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
- [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com)

Make sure that you are sharing your links with **appropriate sharing settings enabled** so that any viewer (such as your instructor) can access your file(s). This is **not** the same as copying the URL directly from the URL bar in your browser.

## Other Software

* [Loom](https://www.loom.com/screen-recorder) has a free tier and a more generous Education tier (also free, but can take up to 7 days for approval)
* [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) is free, extremely flexible, and cross-platform (Mac, Windows, Linux), but requires more technical know-how
* [TinyTake](https://tinytake.com/) is available for free on Windows and also offers annotations
